## Project Goals
Create a calculator web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Phase 1: Create calculator in browser console
I decided to use an array to store the calculation statement, holding numbers and operands. I chose an array due to its functionality to push and pop values, and ease of updating after a calculation is performed. 

## Phase 2: Other logic
Aside from simple calculations, I had to work around logic in the case that another operand or equals is pressed after another number and operand. I also included functionality for decimals to be rounded to two places and functionality for decimal numbers to be calculated.

## Phase 3: Apply styles
I used CSS Grid to create the layout of the buttons I desired. I experimented with a gradient background as well.

## Built With
### Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
### Tools

* Visual Studio Code

## New Skills
* Use CSS Grid to create a specific layout with different buttons
* Use array functions to store data for calculations


## Reflection
This projected posed multiple challenges for me. The early stages were straightforwad but applying different scenarios made me explore other ideas for implementation. If I were to do this project again, I would make sure that the statements displayed properly in the earlier stages.
