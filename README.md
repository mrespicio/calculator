## Project Goals
Create a calculator web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Phase 1: Create calculator in browser console
I decided to use an array to store the calculation statement, holding numbers and operands. I chose an array due to its functionality to push and pop values, and ease of updating after a calculation is performed. Aside from simple calculations, I had to work around logic in the case that another operand or equals is pressed after a number and operand. 

## Phase 2: Style calculator
